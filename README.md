# BrokenImagesDetector
After my HDD was damaged, some of my images were broken. So, that utility helps to detect them and rename with new extension 'bid'.
It is uses multi-core algorithms in its work.
Requires latest JDK 8.

That repository moved to https://github.com/Glare-software/CorruptedImagesDetector
See latest versions there. 
Thank you!
